*Description*<br>
Urodela Games is an independent game studio based in Arlington, VA in USA. The studio was started by solo developer David Dalisay. David runs Urodela Games by himself, as a secondary job to being a Software Engineer. Originally, David started  his game studio journey by simply sharing his game jam projects with the world. After that, David created Urodela Games as a way to make games inspired by his love for animals, wildlife, and zoology and share them with others. But now, he also makes games outside of those genres. Urodela Games released its first game on itch.io titled "Beetle Bunt" - A 2D platformer about a Hercules beetle that flips over blocks to solve puzzles. In January 2022, Urodela Games releases its second game titled "Hexagourds" - A 3D tile-placement puzzle game where players build their own pumpkin patch.

Tweening or "In-Betweening" is simple way to tell Godot "I want my game object  And there's where it will end. Animat". This process is called "In-betweening" because it's essentialy  process of generating images that go between keyframes
</p>

<p>Below, Iâ€™ll provide very simple examples of Godot Tweens using animations from my upcoming indie game, <a href="/hexagourds">Hexagourds</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tweens-shown-simply">Tweens Shown Simply</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Choose an object in your game that you want to animate.</li>
  <li>Choose a property on that object.</li>
  <li>Choose a starting value for that property.</li>
  <li>Choose an ending value for that property.</li>
  <li>Play the tween.</li>
</ul>

<p>Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:</p>

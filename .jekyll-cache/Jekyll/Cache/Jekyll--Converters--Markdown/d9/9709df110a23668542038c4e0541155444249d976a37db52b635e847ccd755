Tweens are a simple way to tell Godot "I want you to animate this object in my game. This is what the object should look like after a certain amount of time." Instead of having to specify what happens during each second of the object's animation, you tell a Godot Tween what the object looks like initially and what it will look like after a a certain amount of time has passed.

<p>Below, I’ll provide very simple examples of Godot Tweens using animations from my upcoming indie game, <a href="/hexagourds">Hexagourds</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-called-tweening">Why is it called “Tweening”?</h3>
<p>Tweening is short for “in-betweening”. When you setup in a Tween in Godot, you provide the Tween 2 “keyframes”:</p>
<ol>
<li> A keyframe that represents what the object should look like at the beginning of the animation and </li>
<li> A keyframe that represents what the object should look like at the end of the animation. </li>
</ol>
<p>When you use a Tween, the Tween automatically generates a bunch of keyframes in between the two keyframes you provided. And it makes the animation look smooth.</p>

<p>Okay I’ve talked too much.</p>

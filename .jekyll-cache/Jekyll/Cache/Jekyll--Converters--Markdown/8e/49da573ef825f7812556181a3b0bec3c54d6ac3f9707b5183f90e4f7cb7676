<p>You make a pumpkin patch! You gain tiles that have autumn-themed items that youâ€™d find at a pumpkin patch: Pumpkins, Haybales, Goats, etc. And you place tiles on an empty grid that will become your own pumpkin patch. You get points along the way in different ways: Like making pumpkin combos and collecting apples from trees.</p>

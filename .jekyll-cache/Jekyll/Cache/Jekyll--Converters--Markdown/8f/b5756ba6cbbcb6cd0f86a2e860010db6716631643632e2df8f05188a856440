Tweens are a simple way to tell Godot "I want you to animate this object in my game. This is what the object should look like after a certain amount of time." Using Tweens, Godot will animate your object smoothly.
</p>

<p>Below, I‚Äôll provide very simple examples of Godot Tweens using animations from my game, <a href="/hexagourds">Hexagourds</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-called-tweening">Why is it called ‚ÄúTweening‚Äù?</h3>
<p>Tweening is short for ‚Äúin-betweening‚Äù. When you setup in a Tween in Godot, you provide the Tween 2 ‚Äúkeyframes‚Äù:</p>
<ol>
<li> A keyframe that represents what the object should look like at the beginning of the animation and </li>
<li> A keyframe that represents what the object should look like at the end of the animation. </li>
</ol>
<p>When you use a Tween, the Tween automatically generates a bunch of keyframes in between the two keyframes you provided. And it makes the animation look smooth.</p>

<p>Okay I‚Äôve talked too much.</p>

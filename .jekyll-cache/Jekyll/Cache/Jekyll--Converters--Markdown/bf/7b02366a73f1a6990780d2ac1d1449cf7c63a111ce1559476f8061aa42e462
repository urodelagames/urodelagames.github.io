Basically, Tweens are a simple way to tell Godot "I want you to animate this object in my game. This is what the object should look like after 5 seconds." Instead of having to specify what happens during each second of the object's animation, you tell a Godot Tween what the object looks like initially and what it will look like after 5 seconds has passed.
</p>

<p>Below, I’ll provide very simple examples of Godot Tweens using animations from my upcoming indie game, <a href="/hexagourds">Hexagourds</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-called-tweening">Why is it called “Tweening”?</h3>
<p>Tweening is short for “in-betweening”. When you setup in a Tween in Godot, you’re telling the Tween 2 keyframes:</p>
<ol>
<li> What the object should look like at the beginning of the animation and 
<li> what the object should look like at the end of the animation. When you use a Tween, the Tween automatically generates a bunch of keyframes in between the two keyframes you specified.

### Tweens Shown Simply
* Choose an object in your game that you want to animate.
* Choose a property on that object.
* Choose a starting value for that property.
* Choose an ending value for that property.
* Play the tween.

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!

### What do you do in Hexagourds?
* You make a pumpkin patch!
* You gain tiles that have autumn-themed items that you'd find at a pumpkin patch: Pumpkins, Haybales, Goats, etc.
* You place tiles on an empty grid that will become your own pumpkin patch.
* You get points along the way in different ways: Like making pumpkin combos and collecting apples from trees.

### How can I follow the progress for Hexagourds?
* Still in development, but you can follow my progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/urodelagames).
* I also have a new [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zMmxceBGkk).
* I'd love to have test/demo players help me decide on future features.

### When will Hexagourds be available?
* You can play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778490/Hexagourds">the free demo on Steam</a> today!

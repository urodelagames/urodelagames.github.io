<p class="message">
  Hexagourds is a casual, relaxing 3D tile-placement game where you rotate and place tiles to make your own pumpkin patch.

### What do you do in Hexagourds?
* You make a pumpkin patch!
* You gain tiles that have autumn-themed items that you'd find at a pumpkin patch: Pumpkins, Haybales, Goats, etc.
* You place tiles on an empty grid that will become your own pumpkin patch.
* You get points along the way in different ways: Like making pumpkin combos and collecting apples from trees.

### How can I follow the progress for Hexagourds?
* Still in development, but you can follow my progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/urodelagames).
* I also have a new [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zMmxceBGkk).
* I'd love to have test/demo players help me decide on future features.

### When will Hexagourds be available?
* I'll be releasing a free demo on itch.io and Steam in the next few weeks. I'm shooting for an October release of a free demo!

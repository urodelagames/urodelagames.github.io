title: Designing Games with Constraints
---
<br>

### A Monthly Challenge

I have a goal of creating 1 game each month. A mini, digital board game, made for solo play.
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/1823030" width="552" height="167"><a href="https://urodelagames.itch.io/monthly-board-game">A Board Game Every Month by Urodela Games</a></iframe>
I call this whole monthly thing *Table Tempo*.

---
### Defining Constraints
For each game, I randomly choose 2 constraints that my game **MUST** use:

1. [A random board game category](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamecategory).
2. [A random board game mechanic](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamemechanic).

Of course, these are chosen from the very popular board game community, [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com).

### Start Designing Differently
Here's where it gets fun.

:green_book: I wrote down what my game constraints *actually involved*.

![test](/photos/flicky-notebook.jpg)

<p style="text-align: center;">On the right, you can see me describing game constraints.</p>

<br>
The above example shows designs from the first Table Tempo game called [*Server Spies*](https://urodelagames.itch.io/server-spies), where my constraints were:

* Mechanic - [Flicking](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2860/flicking)
* Category - [Spies/Secret Agents](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1081/spiessecret-agents)

<br>
Instead of only coming up with finished designs, I brainstormed what *Flicking* means to me in board games:
<br>

<br>
I did the same thing for the category *Spies/Secret Agents*.
<br>
<br>

<br>
I started linking the two graphs, trying to reveal where the category and mechanic could be matched in an interesting and fun way.

<br>
:bulb: After looking through these ideas, I thought of my design:

*"I should make a game where I flick my pieces into the earshot of other pieces so that my pieces can spy on those other pieces for secret information."*

---
### Implementing the design

I start thinking about turning this design into an actual video game...
* :x: ~~Artwork~~
* :x: ~~UI~~
* :x: ~~Different types of pieces~~
* :x: ~~Juicy player feedback~~
* :x: ~~Player testing~~
* :x: ~~Game marketing~~
* :x: ~~Controller inputs~~
* :x: ~~A 3-5 year plan~~
* :x: ~~Retirement~~
* :heavy_check_mark: Player can flick a piece across the screen with mouse. (*Mechanic*)
* :heavy_check_mark: Flicked piece can "listen" to other pieces in earshot. (*Category*)

<p style="text-align: center;">First prototype of <i>Server Spies</i> - The game is ready for Steam :laughing:</p>

<br>
:green_book: I let my constraints remove the tasks that were out of scope, allowing me to focus on a prototype that matched my design.


---
### Playtesting, incremental changes, and emmerging themes
<br>
Okay prototype sorta done. :heavy_check_mark:
<br>
<br>
:grey_question: I playtest, playtest, playtest while making code changes and asking questions about the game:
- What does the player get for flicking into earshot?
- How does the player know their piece is listening to others?
- What is the player even flicking?! What does the piece represent?
- What is the player trying to achieve? What does the player need to do to win?

Thinking back to our constraints, answers emerge (and then some):
- What does the player get for flicking into earshot?
	- _Spies/Secret Agents Category_
		- The player gets information from those other pieces when their piece flicks into earshot.
		- :bulb: Maybe the player is eavesdropping on other people that have secret info.
- How does the player know their piece is listening to others?
	- _Spies/Secret Agents Category_
		- The player gets a text dialog of the other piece that the player's piece is listening to.
		- :bulb: Maybe our piece is intercepting the pieces talking to each other.
- What is the player even flicking?! What does the piece represent?
	- _Spies/Secret Agents Category_
		- :bulb: Maybe the player is flicking their secret agents around, pretending to be butlers.
		- :bulb: :interrobang: Maybe the player is flicking ROBOTS dressed as butlers. And all the other pieces are guests at a party!
- What is the player trying to achieve? What does the player need to do to win?
	- _Spies/Secret Agents Category_
		- :bulb: Maybe the player needs to listen in on every guest's conversations, deducing which one is to blame.
		- :bulb: Maybe the game is a murder mystery!

<p style="text-align: center;"> :robot: :robot: :robot: <b>ROBO-BUTLERS</b>  :robot: :robot: :robot:</p>
<br>

I understand how weird this game got... but I loved the idea and I think it fit the constraints nicely!

:green_book: I looped over this step several times, constantly asking if the changes I'm doing actually address my constraints.

### Grind the game development.

Here's the section about the game development: 
- We write tons of code.
- We design UI.
- We wire up player inputs.
- We test until the game is "good enough". 

Since this is a game design article, I'm not going to discuss the technical details. 

:green_book: But for all you game devs, I validate you and the pain that is required to code a game. This section is for you. :smile:

... Anyways.

### "Being done" with my game.

Games are never finished, anyone in game development knows that. But I knew for a monthly challenge how important is was to "be done" with this game - FOR NOW!

Here's a list of things regarding constraints I thought about as I closed:
- Does my game fulfill my original constraints?
- If you strip away the assets and the juice, does my game still address my constraints?
- When other people player my game, do they notice the constraints? Or do they notice something completely different?
- How long did it take me to design the game vs implement the game?
	- Did I design too big of a game? Or did I implement more than I designed?

<br>
And of course, enjoy the moment of a "finished" game:

### Thanks for reading.
That's it for now. I'd love to hear your feedback on this type of game design process. 

I'd also love for you all to play + hear about the board games I put out each month:
- [Play this month's game!](https://urodelagames.itch.io/monthly-board-game)
- [Get notified of every new game on Table Tempo.](https://mailchi.mp/e4a0e4a69641/new-board-game)

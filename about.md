  Hello! My name is David Dalisay but I usually go by the name Urodela Games.
</p>

I'm a solo indie game developer from Arlington, VA in USA. This is my blog about game development things. Game dev involves way too many things, but I enjoy almost all of it. I enjoy game design the most - So I talk a lot about how the dev, art, and music choices I make impact my game's overall game design.

I recently made a game called [Hexagourds](/hexagourds): A relaxing rotate-em-up game where you make a pumpkin patch.
